# UNCodes
Select coding assignments and projects from my time at UNC

Some of these were removed due to similarity with still assigned course work at UNC, but what remains are small interesting analyses or multi-week long projects.

For the machine learning final project, I was fully responsible for all content through the logistic regression based approaches, and partially responsible for everything after.
